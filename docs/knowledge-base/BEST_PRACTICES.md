## Data Entry Best Practices

### Enter Trips Immediately

**✅ Best Practice**: Add trips right after booking

**Why**:
- Fresh in your mind
- Accurate details
- Real-time analytics
- Less backlog

**How**:
1. Book a trip for your client
2. Open VoyagrIQ on your phone/computer
3. Click "Add Trip"
4. Enter details (takes 2 minutes)
5. Save

**❌ Avoid**: Letting trips pile up for weeks

### Use Consistent Naming

**✅ Best Practice**: Standardize how you enter data

**Client Names**:
- **Do**: "John Smith", "Acme Corporation", "Smith Family"
- **Don't**: "john", "ACME CORP.", "The Smiths"

**Why it matters**: Client overrides won't work if names don't match exactly.

**Destinations**:
- **Do**: "Paris, France", "Tokyo, Japan", "New York, NY"
- **Don't**: "paris", "TOKYO", "NYC"

**Pro tip**: Create a naming convention document for your team.

### Complete All Fields

**Critical fields** (always fill in):
- Client name
- Destination
- Departure & return dates
- Number of travelers
- Base cost
- Commission rate

**Optional but useful**:
- Vendor names (for analytics)
- Client type (individual/corporate/group)
- Trip notes (special requests, issues)
- Add-ons and fees

**Why**: More data = better analytics and reports.

### Use Categories and Tags

**✅ Best Practice**: Organize trips for easy filtering

**Examples**:
- **Trip Type**: Honeymoon, Family, Business, Group
- **Season**: Summer, Winter, Holiday
- **Status**: Booked, Traveled, Cancelled
- **Priority**: VIP, Standard, Budget

**How to use**:
1. Create tags in Settings
2. Apply when adding trips
3. Filter reports by tag

---

## Pricing Strategy

### Set Realistic Default Rates

**✅ Best Practice**: Use market rates, not wishful thinking

**Industry averages**:
- Individual clients: 15-20%
- Corporate clients: 10-15%
- Group travel: 12-18%

**Start here**:
1. Research competitor rates
2. Set your default slightly lower
3. Adjust based on analytics
4. Increase gradually as you prove value

### Use Tiered Pricing

**✅ Best Practice**: Different rates for different client types

**Example structure**:
```
Standard Clients: 15%
Corporate Accounts: 12%
VIP Clients: 10%
Group Travel: 13%
```

**How to implement**:
1. Go to Settings → Agency Settings
2. Set default rates by client type
3. Create client overrides for VIPs
4. Review quarterly

### Negotiate Vendor Rates

**✅ Best Practice**: Track negotiated rates in vendor rules

**Workflow**:
1. Negotiate discount with vendor (e.g., "10% off Hilton")
2. Add vendor rule immediately
3. Set effective dates
4. Document in description field
5. Review before renewal

**Pro tip**: Review all vendor rules quarterly to ensure you're still getting best rates.

### Don't Under-Price VIPs

**❌ Common Mistake**: Giving VIP clients such low rates you don't profit

**✅ Better Approach**:
- Calculate your costs (time + overhead)
- Set minimum profitable rate
- Offer value-adds instead of lower rates
- Example: 12% rate + free travel planning

**How to check profitability**:
1. Go to Analytics
2. Filter by client
3. Check "Revenue per Hour Worked"
4. Adjust rates if needed

## Team Management

### Define Clear Roles

**✅ Best Practice**: Assign responsibilities before inviting team

**Roles to consider**:
- **Admin**: Full access, billing, settings
- **Manager**: Add/edit trips, view all data
- **Advisor**: Add/edit own trips only
- **View-Only**: See reports, no editing

**How to set up**:
1. Go to Settings → Team
2. Invite member
3. Choose role
4. Set permissions

### Create a Daily Workflow

**✅ Best Practice**: Establish routine for trip entry

**Example morning routine**:

3. Generate client invoices
4. Update team on special trips

**Pro tip**: Use scheduled reports to automate daily summaries.

### Hold Weekly Reviews
